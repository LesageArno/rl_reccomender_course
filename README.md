## Overview

This project implements a reinforcement learning framework for **sequential, job-oriented course recommendation**, with explicit modeling of skill mastery and personalized career objectives.

The core research question addressed is:

> How can we recommend an ordered sequence of courses that reduces skill gaps toward relevant jobs, while accounting for graded expertise levels and learner-specific goals?

Unlike traditional employability-based recommenders that optimize only the number of accessible jobs, this system:

- models skills with discrete mastery levels,
- explicitly measures skill-gap reduction,
- formulates reward signals grounded in the **Usefulness of Information** principle,
- supports preference-conditioned goal filtering (wanted / avoided skills),
- enforces prerequisite constraints via action masking.

The reinforcement learning environment, reward formulations, and goal-conditioning mechanisms have been redesigned and restructured compared to prior job-oriented course recommendation frameworks.

This repository contains the full implementation used for experimentation and thesis research.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main components:
- a **Chatbot module** with GUI and conversational logic
- a **Reinforcement Learning backend** (UIR)
- supporting datasets and experimental components

## Installation (Windows)

We recommend using a Python virtual environment.

### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 2. Install PyTorch

CUDA (recommended for LLM inference):
```
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```
CPU-only (Not Recommended for LLM Inference)
```
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

### 3. Install Project Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running the Demo (Streamlit GUI)

The Streamlit GUI is the **main entry point** for the project demo.

### Start the GUI

From the project root directory (`rl_recommender_course`):

```bash
streamlit run Chatbot/GUI.py
```

Demo Capabilities

Through the GUI, users can:

- interact with the chatbot in natural language

- specify skills they want to acquire or avoid

- load a resume (CV) in PDF format

- receive personalized course recommendations

- obtain explanations for both preferences and recommendations



---


## Chatbot Commands

The chatbot supports the following commands:

- `:sem <text>`  
  Extracts skill preferences from natural language input and updates the user profile.

- `:rec`  
  Generates a personalized sequence of recommended courses.

- `:myskills`  
  Displays the skills currently associated with the user profile.

- `:show`  
  Shows current include and avoid skill preferences.

- `load resume`  
  Extracts skills from a resume (PDF) and updates the user profile.

- `clear`  
  Resets the user profile and clears all preferences.

which are automatically computed when using streamlit with specific buttons


## Reinforcement Learning Backend (UIR)

The **UIR (Usefulness-based Information Reward)** approach is the primary reinforcement learning
method used in this project.

### Key Characteristics

- **Algorithm**: PPO / MaskablePPO  
- **State**: learner skill vector and preferences  
- **Action space**: available courses  
- **Reward**: usefulness-based (skill acquisition and job Employability)

Pretrained models are not included in the repository since they are too large.



## Training a Reinforcement Learning Model

Training a new reinforcement learning model is **required** to run the demo.

### Configure Training

Edit the configuration file:

text
UIR/config/run.yaml


This file controls:

TODO

### Run Training
```
python -m UIR.Scripts.pipeline --config UIR/config/run.yaml
```

Training outputs, logs, and models are saved according to the configuration.

#### Hyperparameter Optimization

Hyperparameter optimization is supported via tuning.py.
This feature is experimental and not required for standard usage

## Models

### Named Entity Recognition (NER).
- The model is used to extract skill mentions from user input.
- The model path is configured directly in `chat_handler.py`.

### Large Language Model (LLM)

- The chatbot uses an LLM downloaded automatically from HuggingFace.
- Default model:
  - `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2`
- The first run may take several minutes due to model download.

### Reinforcement Learning Models

- Pretrained RL models are stored in:
  text
  UIR/models_weights/

You should train an RL agent before using it.
To decide which model to use, you must change run.yaml.

## Hardware Notes

- A GPU is **strongly recommended** for running the chatbot with the LLM.
- CPU-only execution is supported but will be significantly slower.
- Reinforcement learning training primarily runs on CPU.

## Notes

- This project is intended for **research and demonstration purposes**.
- Code clarity and modularity are prioritized over production-level optimization.
- Detailed methodological explanations are provided in the associated publication.

This work builds upon the job-oriented course recommendation framework introduced by Jibril Frej in JCRec:

Early development was based on Mark’s extension of this framework:

- WUIR-CLASS-recSys: https://github.com/bm1nhtr/WUIR-CLASS-recSys

The current implementation substantially restructures the reinforcement learning environment, reward modeling, and training pipeline, and does not rely on the original CLASS-based approach.
